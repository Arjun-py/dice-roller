# dice-roller

#This code is a simple dice rolling simulator. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

#1. The code first imports the random module, which is used to generate random numbers.

#2. It then defines six multiline strings (one to six) representing the six faces of a dice, with each face displaying a different number of dots (â¬›).

#3. The program prompts the user to enter any key to start the simulation.

#4. Once the user enters a key, the program enters a loop where it continuously rolls the dice (generates a random number between 1 and 6) and prints the corresponding dice face.

#5. After each roll, the program prompts the user to enter 'r' to continue rolling or any other key to stop.

#6. If the user enters 'r', the loop continues, and the dice is rolled again. If the user enters anything else, the program prints an error message and breaks out of the #loop, ending the simulation.

#In essence, this code provides a simple interactive dice rolling experience, allowing users to continuously roll a dice until they choose to stop.
